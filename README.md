Notes
-----
Facilitated communication between HomeActivity and CreateUserFragment with a shared ViewModel. All data is downloaded via Retrofit and stored into Room before being distributed to the views from the applicationâ€™s repository. 

LiveData is used to broadcast Network / Loading status to indicate when the app is offline or encounters an error. RecyclerViews are wrapped in SwipeRefreshLayouts to refresh repository data.
